# When installing the new YAML-style plugin, we need to ensure that data and
# plugin settings are migrated. We have to jump through hoops to do this:
# * The plugin ID of the old .pl plugins isn't recreatable in YAML, so we
#   can't just pick it up and go.
# * The YAML plugin can't just run an upgrade because the *new* YAML plugin 
#   hasn't been installed yet and therefore has no need to be upgraded.
#
# The solution then is to install the new YAML plugin, then force the upgrade
# to run. We can do this by checking on the old .pl plugin's existence in the
# mt_config table and using that to know if we need to run an upgrade.

    # ID ("ajaxrating") exists, which means the plugin has completed
