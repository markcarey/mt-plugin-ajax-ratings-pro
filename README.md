Refer to the above URL for documentation on this plugin. The following
documents additions made since version 1.261.

# Upgrading

Version 1.3+ is converted to a `config.yaml` style plugin. Be sure to remove
the old `AjaxRating.pl` file when upgrading.

The upgrade process itself may not go smoothly with this change. You should
expect to see an upgrade notice from MT twice: once to install the
`config.yaml` style plugin, and a second time to migrate and update data.

Version 1.3 also changes its table names, shortening them for compatibility
with Oracle. This change won't require any modification to your templates. The
change does require you to work with the database: the old table
`mt_ajaxrating_votesummary` will need a new column created:
`ajaxrating_votesummary_vote_dist` as type `text`. This must be done before
the new plugin is installed.

Plugin data is stored differently with the `config.yaml` style, so you will
need to re-set Ajax Rating Plugin Settings, at both the System and Blog level.

# Configuration

In System Overview > Plugins > Ajax Rating Pro > Settings, you'll find an
option to Enable IP Checking. This checkbox provides an easy way to restrict
votes by IP address. Disable during development for easy testing.

# Tag Reference

## AjaxRatingVoteDistribution

The tag `AjaxRatingVoteDistribution` is a block tag that will provide insight
to the votes received on an object. Within this block tag, access the `score`
and `vote` variables to understand the voting distribution, as in the
following example:

    <mt:AjaxRatingVoteDistribution>
        <mt:If name="__first__">
        <ul>
        </mt:If>
            <li><mt:Var name="score"> stars received <mt:Var name="vote"> votes.</li>
        <mt:If name="__last__">
        </ul>
        </mt:If>
    </mt:AjaxRatingVoteDistribution>

As you'll notice, the loop meta variables are also supported, including
`__first__`, `__last__`, `__odd__`, `__even__`, and `__counter__`.
